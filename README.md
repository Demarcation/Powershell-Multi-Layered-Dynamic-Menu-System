# Powershell-Multi-Layered-Dynamic-Menu-System

A Multi Layered Dynamic Menu System for PowerShell.
The system takes a Nested HashTable input to create a menu system

Its usage is fairly self explanatory

First import the module into your own script.
Import-Module c:\users\fred\downloads\MenuSystem.psm1

Then use the menu with the following command
Use-Menu -MenuHash <HashTable> -Title <String>

Help info is included in the script, contact me for the rest
